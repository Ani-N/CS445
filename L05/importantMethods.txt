Here the some functions we are highlighting:

boolean add( elem) Adds an elem to this set. Dupes bounce off and return false 

boolean addAll( set ) Adds all of the elem of some other set to this set. If all elms in other set
		      are dupes of existing elems then nothing is added and it returns false

boolean contains(Object o) T/F if the incoming elem is in the set

boolean remove(Object o)  behaves just as you would expect

 ** Methods inherited from super class java.util.AbstractSet ** TreeSet IS A Set

boolean equals( set ) returns true if this and other set contain all same elems

boolean removeAll( set ) modifies this set by removing any elems of other set from this set

 ** Methods inherited from super class java.util.AbstractCollection   ** TreeSet IS A Collection

boolean containsAll( set ) returns true/false does this set contain all of the elems in other set 

boolean retainAll ( set ) modifies this such such that it keeps in itself only thos elems in the other set
